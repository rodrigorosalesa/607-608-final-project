I've been having a hard time finding a place willing to sign a 4-month lease and was wondering if anyone has any tips/specific properties to point me towards. My main preferences are that it be in the downtown core (or within walkable distance - beltline etc.), and be a 1 bedroom, 1 bath. I'm trying to avoid Airbnb for now as the prices are generally outrageous during that timeframe. Thanks in advance! :)\n",

I am a Canadian passport holder and citizenship holder through my dad, who is from Toronto. I have been to Calgary twice before at ages 5 and 15, and something about the city absolutely captured my heart.
